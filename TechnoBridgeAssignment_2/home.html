    <h1>What Is Clinical Research and Why It Matters?</h1>
      <h3>What is Clinical Research?</h3>
      <p>
        Clinical Research is a branch of healthcare that deals with the trials of new drugs. 
        This research includes trials on healthy human beings and patients at the initial stage. 
        It’s done to decide a line of treatment for deadly diseases. Clinical research is conducted at various 
        research and medical centers. With the help of new drugs, professionals can improve the health of a patient.
      </p>
      <h3>Scope of Clinical Research</h3>
      <p>
        India is the global hub of clinical trials. So, many MNCs are setting up research centers in India. 
        This is because clinical trials and studies are an integral part of clinical research. Clinical research determines 
        the safety and effectiveness of medicines, devices, and treatments. The safety and effectiveness of medicines 
        and treatments are carried out before their availability in the market. Thus, there is a huge demand for trained 
        clinical research professionals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The demand for professionals is not only in India but worldwide too. For example, Clinical Research provides excellent 
        job opportunities in the USA, Europe, Singapore, and India. There are more than 2.5 lakh worldwide 
        <a href="#"><strong>career opportunities in clinical research</strong></a>. Furthermore, the global clinical trials market size is expected 
        to reach USD 68.9 billion by 2026. It is projected to expand at a CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period. 
        Therefore, there is a huge scope for clinical research in the coming years.
